# FST_project
This is a project for the "Fortgeschrittene Softwaretechnik" (FS or FST) course. An alternate Atari Breakout video game.

required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 1. Git
Used Git for synchronizing project related files between my home PC and Uni Laptop.

(and because it was mandatory for the final submission of the "Fortgeschrittene Softwaretechnik" course)

## 2. UML 
There were three UML diagramms created for this project. Each of them shall be able to be pumped up artificially as intended in the Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

## 9. IDE

I use **Visual Studio Code** as my IDE. It was the first IDE I got introduced to and since then there was never a big enough reason to switch to another IDE. I like the look and feel to it and especially it's easy to use interactive window. Plus it has a lot of useful preinstalled features and installing new ones isn't that hard either. Debugging is easy too!

#### *personal shortcuts*:

- ```numpad /``` --> open new interactive window

#### *regular shortcuts*:

- ```shift + enter```   --> run line in interactive window (has to be enabled in settings)
- ```strg + f OR f3```  --> search in code + option to replace by text
- ```strg + z OR y```   --> undo/redo

## 10. DSL
TBD

## 11. Functional Programming
